Introduction:

1. Mixing of the upper ocean by the wind field associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) creates observable cold wakes in sea surface temperature and may potentially influence ocean heat uptake. We derive a novel oceanic metric of tropical cyclone size based on its induced cold wake using sea surface temperature data for a period from 2002 to 2011.

2. The cold wake size dataset is based on the daily NOAA 1/4Â° Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature, AVHRR + AMSR subset. Two objective cold wake size metrics are derived based on image processing methods: rROI -- based on the Region of Interest method, and rPOL -- based on the azimuthal mean of cold wake in polar coordinates.

More information about the pretreatment and determination of rROI/rPOL please refer to Zhang et al. (2019).
